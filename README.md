# swift-fasta-redux

This project implements the `fasta-redux` benchmark in Swift.  `fasta-redux` is one of the benchmarks that is part of [The Computer Language
Benchmarks Game](http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org).

The code is implemented entirely using the Swift standard library, and does not use Foundation.

Pull requests with performance improvements are very welcome!
